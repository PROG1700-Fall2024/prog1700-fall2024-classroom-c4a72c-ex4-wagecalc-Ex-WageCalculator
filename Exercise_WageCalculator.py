# WAGE CALCULATOR
# Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of hours they worked this week and the dollar amount they make per hour. 
# Use these values to calculate the amount of money they made this week. 
# If the # of hours exceeds 40 in a week, include the amount of overtime pay they made in the total. 
# Overtime pays time-and-a-half (1.5X) the usual hourly wage, and only apply to the # of hours worked over 40.
